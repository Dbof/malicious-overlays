# malicious-overlays
Android app to test different overlay types

This app uses overlays to cover parts of the screen, useful for detection or countermeasure tests.

Note: I use this as test app to play around with overlay detection and for implementing countermeasures against attacks. See [Cloak & Dagger](http://cloak-and-dagger.org/) for more information.
